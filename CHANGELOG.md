# Changelog

All notable changes to Turboism are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Expanded the GitHub README with the supported Windows host platform, exact Cubism Editor versions, installation choices, current capabilities, and verification guidance.
- Added a regression check that every GitHub Release takes its notes from the matching version section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Grouped reusable test support and cross-module integration tests under `testing/`, and moved reviewed SDK API contracts beneath the `sdk/` domain.
- Separated public Cubism compatibility contracts from ignored local Cubism references and host evidence, and moved generated reference reports under `build/reports/`.
- Strengthened repository hygiene so forced additions of local reference, research, generated-report, and validation-output paths are rejected.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Java 17 agent runtime and public plugin SDK for Live2D Cubism Editor.
- Exact-version runtime adapters for Cubism Editor 5.2.03 and 5.3.02.
- Windows NSIS installer, Lite and Full ZIP distributions, and a cross-platform IzPack installer.
- Official first-party plugin bundle with plugin lifecycle, permission, configuration, localization, task, event, action, menu, toolbar, workspace, and Cubism integration services.
- Plugin package inspection and Plugin Directory integration with deterministic release metadata.
- SHA-256 sidecars for every published installer and archive.

### Changed

- Consolidated public SDK governance into one released API tier with exact Cubism Editor availability annotations.
- Unified runtime event delivery and hardened plugin activation, replacement, teardown, and failure isolation.
- Made release packaging use one shared staged payload and a single reviewed plugin allowlist.

### Fixed

- Stabilized exact-host hooks, public event verification, plugin shutdown, backup continuation fencing, and recent-preview hover thumbnails.
- Hardened package inspection, configuration merging, path handling, report redaction, and supply-chain verification.

### Known limitations

- Windows is the primary Cubism host platform.
- The Java installer is available for macOS and Linux, but macOS Cubism host readiness is not claimed and Linux Cubism hosting is unsupported.
- Published binaries are not code-signed or notarized in this release; verify the accompanying SHA-256 sidecars before installation.
